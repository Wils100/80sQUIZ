# 80sQUIZ
Description - The project is to design and implement a client-side web application which will deliver a 80’s on-line music quiz. The quiz will display a series of ten questions which all relate to songs, bands and artists from the 1980s. The questions will be listed on a single page. It will provide the user with a multiple choice to select an answer from with 4 possible answers, of which one answer is correct.The website will evaluate the user's answer for each question using interface widgets to collect answers and JavaScript to to evaluate and collate correct or incorrect answers. When the user selects the Submit button the user’s score will be displayed. The user will be able to re-take the quiz by clicking on a button at the bottom of the page which will refresh the page to allow the user to have another attempt to answer the questions.
